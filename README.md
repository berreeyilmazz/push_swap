# push_swap (a sorting algorithm)

You have 2 stacks named a and b.
• At the beginning:
◦ The stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers
which cannot be duplicated.
◦ The stack b is empty.
• The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so you have the
following operations at your disposal:
sa (swap a)
sb (swap b)
ss (sa and sb at the same time)
pa (push a)
pb (push b)
ra (rotate a)
rb (rotate b)
rr (ra and rb at the same time)
rra (reverse rotate a)
rrb (reverse rotate b)
rrr (rra and rrb at the same time)
